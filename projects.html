            <!-- Project 1 -->
            <section>
                <h3>Student Grading System</h3>
                <p>
                    For my final project in object oriented programming, I created a student grading system in python.
					Some of the features include adding studnets to database, recording grades, computing gpa, option to sava and load data and also you could plot charts.
                </p>
            </section>
            <!-- Project 2 -->
            <section>
                <h3>Angry Birds Game</h3>
                <p>
                    Another project that I contributed to was the spaced theme angry birds game created in unity. I worked on this with a group of other students.
					The project implements slingshot mechanics, physics‑driven collisions, destructible targets, scoring, and basic level flow. 
					We used C# for gameplay systems (input, projectile behavior, level/state management) and ShaderLab/HLSL to create space‑themed materials and visual effects.
					
                </p>
            </section>
            <!-- Project 3 -->
            <section>
                <h3>Kart Game</h3>
                <p>
                    I built a Unity kart racing prototype that shows the basic feel and control. The project implements core driving mechanics (acceleration, braking, steering),
					a third‑person follow camera, and a simple race loop. Written entirely in C#
                </p>
            </section>
            <!-- Project 4 -->
            <section>
                <h3>Snakes and Ladders Game</h3>
                <p>
                    I also made a C# version of the classic Snakes and Ladders game. It includes a turn-based loop for multiple players, random dice rolls, and a board with configurable
					snakes and ladders that move players forward or backward
